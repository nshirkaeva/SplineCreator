# SplineCreator

The library displays splines under the NanoСad platform.
This module contains an algorithm for computing
smoothing polyline by parabolic spline and Bézier spline in C++ 

The module can be visualized under the Nanocad platform, 

The polyline is two dimensional, defined by a sequence of
its vertices with coordinates (Xi, Yi). 
The user specifies the type of spline and vertices of the polyline. 
The output shows the polyline and the spline obtained in the calculations.
